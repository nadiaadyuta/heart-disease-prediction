# Heart Disease Prediction using Random Forest Classifier



## Project Overview

Heart disease is a major health problem worldwide and early prediction can significantly improve treatment outcomes. This project is leveraging Random Forest classifier to predict the existence of heart disease according to various health indicators.



## Dataset
This dataset contain some medical information of patients which tells whether that person has heart disease or not. It contains 1025 observations with 14 attributes.
- age: Age of the patients in years
- sex: Gender of the patient, which 0: Female and 1: Male
- cp: Type of chest pain felt by the patient, which 0: Typical chest pain; 1: Non-typical chest pain; 2: Chest pain not associated with angina; 3: No chest pain
- trestbps: Patient's resting blood pressure (mmHg).
- chol: The patient's serum cholesterol level (mg/dl)
- fbs: The patient's fasting blood sugar level, which 0: Fasting blood sugar level <120 mg/dl; 1: Fasting blood sugar level >120 mg/dl
- restecg: Resting electrocardiography result, which 0: Normal result; 1: ST-T wave abnormality (invert or ventricular hypertrophy); 2: Indicates possible left ventricular hypertrophy according to Estes criteria
- thalach: Maximum heart rate reached by the patient.
- exang: Presence of exercise-induced angina, which 0: No exercise-induced angina; 1: Exercise-induced angina present
- oldpeak: ST segment depression produced by exercise relative to rest
- slope: The slope of the ST segment during exercise, which 0: Slope is irrelevant; 1: Slope is up; 2: Slope is down
- ca: Number of major blood vessels stained with flourosopy staining, values are 0-3
- thal: Type of thalassemia, which 0: Normal; 1: Fixed defect; 2: Reversable defect
- target: A class label indicating whether or not the patient has heart disease, which 0: No heart disease; 1: Heart disease.
